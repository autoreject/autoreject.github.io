===========================
Automatically repair epochs
===========================

This example demonstrates how to use :mod:`autoreject` to automatically
repair epochs.

Let us first define the parameters. `n_interpolates` are the :math:`\rho`
values that we would like :mod:`autoreject` to try and `consensus_percs`
are the :math:`\kappa` values that :mod:`autoreject` will try (see the
`autoreject paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.030>`_) for
more information on these parameters).

Epochs with more than :math:`\kappa * N` sensors (:math:`N` total sensors)
bad are dropped. For the rest of the epochs, the worst :math:`\rho`
bad sensors (as determined by channel-level thresholds) are interpolated.
The exact values of these parameters are not preselected but learned from
the data. If the number of bad sensors for a particular trial is less than
:math:`\rho`, all the bad sensors are interpolated.

For the purposes of this example, we shall use the MNE sample dataset.
Therefore, let us make some MNE related imports.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-42

.. code-block:: default


    import mne  # noqa
    from mne.utils import check_random_state  # noqa
    from mne.datasets import sample  # noqa








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-47

Now, we can import the class required for rejecting and repairing bad
epochs. :func:`autoreject.compute_thresholds` is a callable which must be
provided to the :class:`autoreject.AutoReject` class for computing
the channel-level thresholds.

Let us now read in the raw `fif` file for MNE sample dataset.

    data_path = sample.data_path()

We can then read in the events

And pick MEG channels for repairing. Currently, :mod:`autoreject` can repair
only one channel type at a time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-77

.. code-block:: default


    raw.info['bads'] = []
    picks = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg='grad', eeg=False, stim=False, eog=False,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-81

Now, we can create epochs. The ``reject`` params will be set to ``None``
because we do not want epochs to be dropped when instantiating
:class:`mne.Epochs`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-86

.. code-block:: default

    raw.del_proj()  # remove proj, don't proj while interpolating
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax,
                        baseline=(None, 0), reject=None,
                        verbose=False, detrend=0, preload=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-89

:class:`autoreject.AutoReject` internally does cross-validation to
determine the optimal values :math:`\rho^{*}` and :math:`\kappa^{*}`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-97

Note that :class:`autoreject.AutoReject` by design supports
multiple channels.
If no picks are passed, separate solutions will be computed for each channel
type and internally combined. This then readily supports cleaning
unseen epochs from the different channel types used during fit.
Here we only use a subset of channels to save time.
