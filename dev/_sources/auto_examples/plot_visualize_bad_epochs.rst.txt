Note that :class:`autoreject.AutoReject` by design supports multiple
channels. If no picks are passed separate solutions will be computed for each
channel type and internally combines. This then readily supports cleaning
unseen epochs from the different channel types used during fit.
Here we only use a subset of channels to save time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 97-101

Also note that once the parameters are learned, any data can be repaired
that contains channels that were used during fit. This also means that time
may be saved by fitting :class:`autoreject.AutoReject` on a
representative subsample of the data.
