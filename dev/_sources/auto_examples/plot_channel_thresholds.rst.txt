=============================
Plot channel-level thresholds
=============================

This example demonstrates how to use :mod:`autoreject` to find
channel-wise thresholds.

Let us first load the `raw` data using :func:`mne.io.read_raw_fif`.

We can extract the events (or triggers) for epoching our signal.

    event_fname = data_path + ('/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw-'

    tmin, tmax = -0.2, 0.5
    events = mne.read_events(event_fname)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-36

Now that we have the events, we can extract the trials for the selection
of channels defined by ``picks``.

    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-49

Now, we compute the channel-level thresholds using
:func:`autoreject.compute_thresholds`. The `method` parameter will determine
how we will search for thresholds over a range of potential candidates.
