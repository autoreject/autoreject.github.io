===================================================
Preprocessing workflow with ``autoreject`` and ICA
===================================================
This example demonstrates how to visualize data when preprocessing
with :mod:`autoreject` and discusses decisions about when and which
other preprocessing steps to use in combination.

**tldr**: We recommend that you first highpass filter the data,
then run autoreject (local) and supply the bad epochs detected by it
to the ICA algorithm for a robust fit, and finally run
autoreject (local) again.

First, we download resting-state EEG data from a Parkinson's patient
from OpenNeuro. We will do this using ``openneuro-py`` which can be
installed with the command ``pip install openneuro-py``.

We will now load in the raw data from the bdf file downloaded from OpenNeuro
and, since this is resting-state data without any events, make regularly
spaced events with which to epoch the raw data. In the averaged plot,
we can see that there may be some eyeblink
artifact contamination but, overall, the data is typical of
resting-state EEG.

Autoreject without any other preprocessing
------------------------------------------
Now, we'll naively apply autoreject as our first preprocessing step.

As we can see in the plot of the rejected epochs, there are many eyeblinks
that caused the epoch to be dropped. This resulted in a lot of the data
being lost.

The data looks fairly clean already and we don't want to interpolate
more than a few sensors since we only have 32 to start, so the
number of channels to interpolate was set to check some low numbers

    ar.fit(epochs[:20])  # fit on a few epochs to save time

Autoreject with high-pass filter
--------------------------------
The data may be very valuable and the time for the experiment
limited and so we may want to take steps to reduce the number of
epochs dropped by first using other steps to preprocess the data.
We will use a high-pass filter first to remove slow drift that could
cause epochs to be dropped.

When making this decision to filter the data, we do want to be careful
because filtering can spread sharp, high-frequency transients and
distort the phase of the signal. Most evoked response potential
analyses use filtering since the interest is in the time series, but
if you are doing a frequency based analysis, filtering before the
Fourier transform could potentially be avoided by detrending instead.

    Filtering raw data in 1 contiguous segment
    Setting up high-pass filter at 1 Hz

    FIR filter parameters
    ---------------------
    Designing a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal highpass filter:
    - Windowed time-domain design (firwin) method
    - Hamming window with 0.0194 passband ripple and 53 dB stopband attenuation
    - Lower passband edge: 1.00
    - Lower transition bandwidth: 1.00 Hz (-6 dB cutoff frequency: 0.50 Hz)
    - Filter length: 1691 samples (3.303 sec)

ICA
---
Finally, we can apply independent components analysis (ICA) to remove
eyeblinks from the data. If our analysis were to be very dependent on
sensors at the front of the head, we could skip ICA and use the previous
result. However, ICA can increase the amount of usable data by applying
a spatial filter that downscales the data in sensors most affected by eyeblink
artifacts.

Note that ICA works best if bad segments of the data are removed
Hence, we will remove the bad segments from the
previous run of autoreject for the benefit of the ICA algorithm.

Autoreject with highpass filter and ICA
---------------------------------------
We can see in this section that preprocessing, especially ICA, can be made
to do a lot of the heavy lifting. There isn't a huge difference when viewing
the averaged data because the ICA effectively limited the number
of epochs that had to be dropped. However, there are still artifacts such as
non-stereotypical blinks that weren't able to be removed by ICA, channel
"pops" (sharp transients with exponential RC decay), muscle artifact such as
jaw clenches and gross movement artifact that could still impact analyses.

These are the basic steps for a workflow with decisions that must be
made based on what the data is being used for. Following this may help
you optimize your use of ``autoreject`` in preprocessing.

We will do a few more visualizations to see that removing the bad epochs
found by ``autoreject`` is still important even with preprocessing first.
This is especially important if your analyses include trial-level statistics
such as looking for bursting activity. We'll visualize why autoreject
excluded these epochs and the effect that including these bad epochs would
have on the data.

First, we will visualize the reject log

Next, we will visualize the cleaned average data and compare it against
the bad segments.

Finally, don't forget that we are working with resting state data
here. Here we used long epochs of 3 seconds so that frequency-domain
analysis was possible with the epochs. However, this could also lead
to longer segments of the data being rejected. If you want more
fine-grained control over the artifacts, you can
construct shorter epochs and use the autoreject log to mark
annotations in MNE that can be used to reject the data during doing
time-frequency analysis. We want to emphasize that there
is no subsitute for visual inspection. Irrespective of the rejection
method used, we highly recommend users to inspect their preprocessed
data before further analyses.
